Team Builder App

What is this application for?

    The Team Builder App is designed to allow a company to input, store, and search through their employee resumes. 
    It allows them to quickly search for specific skills, credentials, and work roles held by the employees in order to build an 
    efficient team with the necessary skill sets for a project.
